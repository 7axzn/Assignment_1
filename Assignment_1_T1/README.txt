There are 10 text files to test problem 11.

How to Use for Testing:
Files 1 and 2: There is a subtle difference in wording ("It's" vs "It is") in the third line for character-by-character comparison.
Files 3 and 4: Small changes in wording ("must" vs "need to" and "huge" vs "big") for word-by-word comparison.
Files 5 and 6: These have slight variations in phrasing ("transforming" vs "changing" and "improves" vs "can improve") for both character and word comparisons.
Files 7 and 8 are identical word by word (ignoring spaces, tabs, or newlines), but they differ character by character because of the extra spaces in File 8.
Files 9 and 10 are exactly identical in all cases, both word by word and character by character.

the program will ask you for the name of the file that you wish to load.
make sure to type the correct name of the file when loading and if you did not the program will loop until you do.

all the test files were writtin by chat-gpt.
